# Wine-Quality-Predictor
Different classifier models were used to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. I have converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    1 - Fixed acidity
    2 - Volatile acidity
    3 - Citric sugar
    4 - Residual sugar
    5 - Chlorides
    6 - Free sulphur dioxide
    7 - Total sulphur dioxide
    8 - Density
    9 - pH
    10 - Sulphates
    11 - Alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - Quality (score between 0 and 10)

Objectives:

The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy. 
2. To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine.

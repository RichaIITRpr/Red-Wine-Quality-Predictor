# Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor
A Logistic regression model to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. We have converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
  Fixed acidity
  Volatile acidity
  Citric sugar
  Residual sugar
  Chlorides
  Free sulphur dioxide
  Total sulphur dioxide
  Density
  pH
  Sulphates
  Alcohol
